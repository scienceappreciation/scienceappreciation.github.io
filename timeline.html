                <h2>2019</h2>
                <p>Starting when I was 15 I became interested in how games are made. Throughout this time I began trying to learn the Unity Game Engine through YouTube tutorials but I was mostly unsuccessful.</p>

            <div role="presentation">
                <h2>2020</h2>
                <p>As one can imagine 2020 was mostly a "waiting" year. I mainly floated around looking for bits of knowledge and created my first website which I do not have a sample of.</p>

            <div role="presentation">
                <h2>2021</h2>
                <p>in 2021 I successfully obtained my GED and mostly did small things here and there related to Game Development.</p>
            </div>
            <div role="presentation">
                <h2>2022</h2>
                <p>This was really when my programming knowledge went into full swing as I discovered Harvard's CS50 course on edX which aided me in my understanding of how machines work at their core. Once I knew what I didn't know it became more trivial to begin courses. During this year I completed a UDemy course focused around GitHub and landed my first freelancing gig as a Game Developer.</p>

                <h2>2023 - Present</h2>
                <p>After finishing my Freelance gig I decided to seek formal knowledge and started my course on Codecademy to become a Web Developer so that I may support my passion for creating things.</p>
